# Surfs up
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the weather trends for the months of June and December in Oahu.  This research was to evaluate different locations based on weather data and which area would be most viable for the possibility of opening a surf and ice cream store. 

## Results
  -June temperatures range from a low of 64 to a high of 85 degrees fahrenheit, with an average of 75 degrees.
  
  -December temperatures range from a low of 56 to a high of 83 degrees fahrenheit, with an average of 71 degrees.

  -The standard deviation in June is 3.25 and in December is 3.74, making a .5 difference between the two months and also explaining the wider range in temperatures    for the month of December. 
  
## Summary
This anaylsis is a good start in getting an idea for what the temperature trends are for Oahu.  However, to get a better understanding I would recommend running 2 additional queries for March and August to have an idea of how temperature trends change during the seasons throughout the year.  In addition, I would suggest adding an anaylsis on preceipication or cloud cover so that the business owners understand the locations with the best weather trends and will know the areas visitors are more likely to travel to.
